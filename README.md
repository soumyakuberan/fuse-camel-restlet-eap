## JBoss EAP Camel RESTful Web-service

This is a template Apache Camel RESTful web-service for the JBoss EAP Camel subsystem. 

This project is setup to allow you to create an Apache Camel application (Spring or Java DSLs are in use), which can be deployed 
to an application server running the JBoss EAP Camel subsystem. An example [Spring XML](src/main/webapp/META-INF/jboss-camel-context.xml)
Camel Route as well as [Java DSL](src/main/java/lv/jbossfuse/course/restlet/MyCamelContextBuilder.java) one have been created for you.


### Prerequisites

* Minimum of Java 1.7
* Maven 3.2 or greater
* JBoss EAP 6.4


### Getting started at the Command Line

1. Install JBoss Fuse on your application server

2. Configure a $JBOSS_HOME environment variable to point at your application server installation directory

3. Start the application server from the command line

For Linux:
```
$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone.xml
```

For Windows:
```
%JBOSS_HOME%\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone.xml
```


### Building the application

To build the application do:

```
# mvn clean install
```


### Deploying the application
